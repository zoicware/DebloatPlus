## Debloat+

This PowerShell Script is a standalone version from [zoicware](https://github.com/zoicware/ZOICWARE) debloat option.

### How is it Better?

There are hundreds of other debloat scripts for windows however most of them have some major downsides. For example, almost all of them have hard coded package names leading to bugs overtime as microsoft change them as well as limiting the user to only their specified list.
Furthermore, many scripts include other changes that have nothing to do with debloating with or without the users knowledge. Debloat+ fixes all these downfalls by giving the user complete control as to what gets removed.


### Features

- No hardcoded packages for removal only packages that are unable/shouldnt be removed (breaks windows) are hard coded
- Option to remove locked packages on Windows 10 and Windows 11 23h2 (24h2 latest versions patched this exploit)
- Microsoft Edge Removal Including Webview option
- Debloat Presets for ease of use catering to most users


### How to Use

- Run the `Allow Script to Run.reg` if you havent changed PowerShells Execution Policy to Unrestricted or Bypass
- Run Debloat+ and choose your desired options
